      <b> My name is Joseph McDermott </b>, but I go by <b> JT. </b> 
      I was raised in Annapolis Maryland, and I am currently enrolled at Tulane University in New Orleans, 
      Louisiana where I am pursuing a BS in Economics, a BS in Computer Science, and a minor in Portuguese. 
      My professional curiosities include software, data analysis, economic modeling, financial markets, 
      and more. Outside of my busy life, I enjoy playing guitar, reading, and being outside. My resume below 
      contains a full overview of my skills and experience.
